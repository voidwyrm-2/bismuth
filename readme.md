# Bismuth Virtual Machine Standard

Bismuth is a universal stack-based virtual machine standard meant to be implemented in any language

This repo acts as both the documentation and the container for the compiler

> **Note:**
> the compiler is not meant to be implemented universally like the VM for simplcity,
> but there's not actually anything holding you back from implementing it in another language

## Documentation

The documentation for the text representation can found in [lang.md](./lang.md)

The specification for the bytecode and virtual machine itself can be found in [spec.md](./spec.md)
